The experiment achieved significant reductions in free asparagine concentration, down to 10% of the control in the grain.

The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.\n\nAsking Questions\n\nHave a question? Instead of opening an issue, please ask on Stack Overflow using the tag visual-studio-code.\n\nThe active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nYour comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.\n\nSee the Feedback Channels wiki page for details on how to share your thoughts.\n\nReporting Issues\n\nHave you identified a reproducible problem in VS Code? Do you have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.\n\nIdentify Where to Report\n\nThe VS Code project is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository. Check the list of Related Projects if you aren't sure which repo is correct.\n\nCan you recreate the issue even after disabling all extensions? If you find the issue is caused by an extension you have installed, please file an issue on the extension's repo directly.\n\nLook For an Existing Issue\n\nBefore you create a new issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.\n\nBe sure to scan through the most popular feature requests.\n\nIf you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a \""+1\"" comment:\n\n\ud83d\udc4d - upvote\n\ud83d\udc4e - downvote\n\nIf you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.\n\nWriting Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests\n\nFile a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.\n\nDo not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.\n\nThe more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.\n\nThe built-in tool for reporting an issue, which you can access by using Report Issue in VS Code's Help menu, can help streamline this process by automatically providing the version of VS Code, all your installed extensions, and your system info. Additionally, the tool will search among existing issues to see if a similar issue already exists.\n\nPlease include the following with each issue:\n\nVersion of VS Code\nYour operating system\nList of extensions that you have installed\nReproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue\nWhat you expected to see, versus what you actually saw\nImages, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring\nA code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally\nNote: Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.\nErrors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)\n\nCreating Pull Requests\n\nPlease refer to the article on creating pull requests and contributing to this project.\n\nFinal Checklist\n\nPlease remember to do the following:\n\n Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue\n Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions\n Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem\n\nDon't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!\n\nFollow Your Issue\n\nOnce submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking workflow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect and how to continue to assist throughout the process.\n\nAutomated Issue Management\n\nWe use GitHub Actions to help us manage issues. These Actions and their descriptions can be viewed here. Some examples of what these Actions do are:\n\nAutomatically close any issue marked info-needed if there has been no response in the past 7 days.\nAutomatically lock issues 45 days after they are closed.\nAutomatically implement the VS Code feature request pipeline.\n\nIf you believe the bot got something wrong, please open a new issue and let us know.\n\nContributing Fixes\n\nIf you are interested in writing code to fix issues, please see How to Contribute in the wiki.\n\nThank You\n\nYour contributions to open source, large or small, make great projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.""}",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_384501532214537292,Success,The bot has successfully completed the task,,

There are few books where the beginning paragraphs hit a home run for me, and this is one of them. It has been a long month filled with family time and endless cooking so for the last ten days I opted for comfort reads and there is no family who provides comfort like the Finches, with the exception of Aunt Alexandra. \u201cLawyers were children once,\u201d quotes Charles Lamb in the opening epithet. Prior to this reading, I viewed Atticus Finch as an unapproachable, older father. Beloved by his children to the point of idolization, but with an impenetrable outer skin. As an adult looking back at the events which shaped the novel, Scout paints the picture of her father as one who makes everything right and makes her feel safe. Even though this novel had been marketed for adults, it is in its essence a coming of age novel, which shows Scout\u2019s growth through elementary school while her family faces events that mean to alter the history of a town. Atticus would need to be a strong figure to guide his children through the plot, and he would need to wistfully remember his childhood in order to relate to them. This is the man who told us all to walk in another\u2019s shoes and see things from their point of view. Until today, I never viewed Atticus as multi-faceted, just a great man.

820,tsk_384504955303471358,completed,"{""video_description"": ""As soon as I arrived in Resident Evil Village\u2019s sinister rural setting, its Resident Evil 4 influence reared its snarling head. Almost immediately surrounded by rabid Lycan locals, I scrambled for shotgun shells and bookshelves to block doorways as the horde closed in, only to be saved a split-second away from death. It\u2019s an intense welcome that serves as a fantastic flashback to the opening of Shinji Mikami\u2019s magnum-toting magnum opus, and one made all the more frantic in first-person perspective. Resident Evil Village might not break much new ground in its own right, but it successfully grafts Resident Evil 4\u2019s best action elements onto the series\u2019 more modern form established in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, making for a genuinely engrossing and increasingly combat-heavy continuation of the Ethan Winters story.\n\nIt\u2019s a story that \u2013 unfortunately for poor old Ethan \u2013 goes from dire straits to dire wolves. Dragged to hillbilly hell and back in an effort to rescue his wife in Resident Evil 7, he subsequently finds himself dropped into a distinctly Transylvanian type of terror in Village. This time it\u2019s his infant daughter who must be saved after she\u2019s kidnapped by a wicked cabal of monster maniacs: Lady Dimitrescu, a vampire tall enough to play center in a Space Jam sequel; Donna Beneviento, a dollmaker with a walking, talking Bride of Chucky sidekick; Salvatore Moreau, a thoroughly repulsive merman; and Karl Heisenberg, a magnetically powered lunatic who runs a factory assembly line of Frankenstein\u2019s monsters.\n\nAll four report to the mysterious head witch, Mother Miranda, and although admittedly none of them managed to coax out the same kind of genuine scares as the southern-fried psychopaths in Resident Evil 7's Baker family, I found the lot of them to be entertainingly twisted in a slightly cartoonish, Batman villain kind of way. Each presides over their own visually distinctive domain that you must survive, from the opulent gold-trimmed interiors of Castle Dimitrescu to the grungy mechanical works of Heisenberg\u2019s subterranean facility. There are noticeable shifts in mood between each setting, with one demanding a more stealth-driven approach while another leans more into psychological horror than combat. Delving into the darkest corners of Village\u2019s world and uncovering the real reason these fairytale freaks have come into existence in the present day made for a compelling mystery that hooked me throughout my 10-hour playthrough.\n\nAside from the aforementioned Lycans \u2013 which come in multiple forms \u2013 there are zombie ghouls, flying gargoyles, full-on werewolves, and more waiting to ambush you at every turn. Their onslaught feels like an aggressive response to one of Resident Evil 7\u2019s most notable shortcomings in the lack of variety in its enemy types; its handful of lumbering monsters were referred to as the \u2018Mold\u2019, an appropriate name, since they quickly grew stale. Village remedies this by throwing a significantly broader set of nasties into your crosshairs; in fact, the last time there was a line-up of village people this diverse they were singing disco songs about the YMCA.\n\nThis expanded roster of bloodthirsty beasts doesn\u2019t just make for a more interestingly evolving series of combat encounters, but it also adds some welcome new depth and decision making to the bolstered crafting system. Should you spend your scarce supply of scrap to cobble together a landmine that will blast the armour off one of the tank-like Lycans, or fashion it into sniper rifle rounds so that you can eliminate nesting gargoyles from afar before they have a chance to swoop down on you?\n\nGranted, most of these enemies aren\u2019t particularly clever in their own right \u2013 the genetically modified mutants of Heisenberg\u2019s factory might have deadly drills for arms, but they\u2019re far from the sharpest tools in the shed when it comes to outmanoeuvring you one-on-one. Still, what Village\u2019s variety of grunts may lack in smarts they certainly make up for in sheer numbers, and although I rarely encountered clusters of more than a handful enemies at a time for the first few hours (outside of the initial overwhelming village reception), at somewhere around its midpoint the size of these enemy swarms started to swell substantially. By the story\u2019s end I was gleefully indulging in chaotic levels of carnage that reminded me more of a run-and-gun Call of Duty campaign than a slow-paced horror game.\n\nThe Duke \u2013 a tubby trader who can be conveniently found in various locations around the map like a Transylvanian 7-11 \u2013 allows you to buy weapon add-ons and upgrades as well as limited amounts of medkits and ammunition. What I appreciated the most about Capcom effectively resurrecting Resident Evil 4\u2019s merchant is that the Duke\u2019s stiff prices forced me to pore over every square inch of Village\u2019s stunning scenery in search of treasures to trade for spending money, which had the knock-on effect of leading me to a number of surprises \u2013 both pleasant and malevolent.\n\nStudying your surroundings for the telltale glint of a valuable gem that can be dislodged with a bullet, or keeping an ear out for the creak of an item-carrying birdcage that can be knocked down aren\u2019t the only ways to uncover rewards for backtracking and exploring off the beaten path. Animals like fish and pigs can be killed, their meat turned into dishes by the Duke that give permanent boosts to Ethan\u2019s health and defense. Actually tracking down some of the more exotic animals requires you to first find photographic clues to their specific locations, and while it\u2019s not particularly challenging to take them down once you\u2019ve found them, I took some dark delight in slashing at a yard full of chickens with Ethan\u2019s pocket knife (it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever come to actually playing a Legend of Zelda game in first-person).\n\nElsewhere, there are countless invaluable story morsels tucked away that provide a clearer picture of ties between the village\u2019s inhabitants and the Umbrella Corporation, as well as mini boss fight encounters that in some instances managed to completely blindside me. One of my favourite face-offs in Village is entirely optional: a close-quarters battle against a towering axe-wielding ogre that I only stumbled onto because I accidentally took a wrong turn on the way to my next story objective.\n\nDespite the horniest hopes of internet perverts, Lady Dimitrescu's appearance is certainly intimidatingly long-legged, but also disappointingly short-lived. It\u2019s clear that this Resident Evil isn\u2019t just called \u2018Village\u2019 so that Capcom could awkwardly shove the Roman numerals for eight into its logo, but because exploring the village itself is a central part of the experience, and one that really helps distinguish it from any other previous instalment in the series. And although you visit each of the main villains\u2019 lairs in a set order, keys and other tools found along the way unlock new paths and secrets that make your return trips through Village\u2019s main hub a consistently rewarding journey.\n\nRoaming the streets of Resident Evil Village is like visiting a disturbing and deadly Disneyland, where every attraction is a house of horrors. I got just as big a thrill out of revelling in its frenzied violence as I did retracing my steps through the gradually revealed recesses of its sizable village setting to uncover the darkest story secrets of its monstrous main cast. Boss fights are a bit of a letdown but the great variety of enemies throughout keeps things tense, especially on Hardcore mode. The fact that it's very much a throwback to the fast-paced action of Resident Evil 4 also means it largely takes a step back from the slow-burn scares of Resident Evil 7's excellent opening hours, which may well disappoint those who prefer more psychological dread to blowing off heads. But if you have an itch for action-heavy survival-horror, then Resident Evil Village will scratch it like a fistful of Lady Dimitrescu\u2019s freakish fingernails.""}",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_384504955303471358,Success,The bot has successfully completed the task,,

The Governor also signed her 'Back to Basics' legislation to improve literacy education. The Budget also extends mayoral control of New York City schools for two years and commissions a study to examine the Foundation Aid formula to ensure the long-term fiscal sustainability of education funding. \""Every student deserves a high-quality education in the State of New York,\"" Governor Hochul said. \""This Budget builds on our record funding for education, lays the groundwork to improve reading proficiency, and puts the state on a path to a more equitable school funding formula.\"" The FY 2025 Budget invests record funding in School Aid \u2013 $35.9 billion, including $24.9 billion in Foundation Aid. Since Governor Hochul took office, she has increased School Aid by the largest amount ever, a $6.5 billion increase over three years. This year, Governor Hochul and the Legislature worked together to ensure schools are getting the support they need while still recognizing the need to modify the Foundation Aid formula. Through the Budget, Governor Hochul is lowering the inflation factor from 3.4 percent to 2.8 percent in the formula to right-size funding for the 2024-25 school year. The Budget also commissions a Rockefeller Institute study to examine the Foundation Aid formula to prepare for changes next year. Governor Hochul\u2019s 'Back to Basics' reading plan ensures every school district utilizes instructional best practices grounded in the science of reading to improve reading proficiency among New York's children. The State Education Department (SED) will provide instructional best practices to school districts in the teaching of reading to students in prekindergarten through grade three by January 1, 2025. School districts will be required to annually review their curriculum and instructional practices for alignment with those issued by SED, and verify by September 2025. The Budget also includes $10 million to train 20,000 teachers in these instructional best practices. Additionally, the Budget expands the State University of New York and the City University of New York\u2019s microcredentialing programs for teachers focused on the science of reading to ensure current and future teachers seeking advanced education are best prepared. The FY 2025 Budget provides a two-year extension of the current system of governance of New York City public schools, which is currently scheduled to expire on June 30, 2024. In connection with this extension, the Budget also establishes a process for selecting an independent chairperson for the schools' Panel for Educational Policy and updates the maintenance of effort requirement in State law in regard to the City's funding of its public schools."", ""summary"": ""Governor Hochul announced record education investments in the FY 2025 Budget, including $36 billion in School Aid, a 'Back to Basics' literacy plan, and a two-year extension of mayoral control for NYC schools."", ""url"": ""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-historic-education-investments-and-signs-legislation-improve-reading"", ""datetime_extracted"": ""2025-04-22T15:29:42.405936-04:00""}",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_384813930942556090,Success,The bot has completed the task successfully,,

The drinks are unique and hand crafted. The wine menu is top-notch, and if you do the pairing with the tasting menus, you cannot go wrong.

What makes Against the Storm so ingenious is how it makes this an engaging challenge every single time through perfectly balanced roguelike mechanics. You never know exactly what citizens you\u2019ll have, what quests you\u2019ll need to complete or what resources you\u2019ll find, so you\u2019ll have to adapt. Your specialty buildings are awarded like cards from a deck, so you\u2019ll have to think about assembling supply chains forwards and backwards. One settlement might be a utopia, where the larder is overflowing and every citizen is well cared for. Or you may struggle with an imperfect supply chain, scraping by just enough to make it through the stormy season.

Now, the studio has one of the most well-supported live-service games in 2025. Every few months, Destiny 2 gets a new season or expansion, adding missions, activities, and endgame content like raids. Each of these different activities then provides its own unique rewards, creating an endless loop of grinding new activities for new weapons, which you\u2019ll then use to grind the next season\u2019s content.

There is no specific date for the skins or the cost as of right now. The art revealed for the comic features several Marvel characters having fun in the sun and playing swimming pool games.

1683,tsk_390748941858548682,completed,"{""answer_explanation"": ""The origin of the 'unhandled promise rejection' error in JavaScript is that every promise is expected to handle rejection, typically by using a .catch(...) handler. If a promise is rejected and there is no .catch handler attached, the JavaScript engine (or Node.js) will emit a warning or error about an unhandled promise rejection. This is important because a rejected promise is like an exception that bubbles up and, if not handled, can cause the application to terminate or behave unexpectedly. \n\nFor example, if you create a promise and only attach a .then handler, but not a .catch, any error or rejection will not be handled, leading to this warning. Even if you attach a .catch handler, the way you chain your handlers matters. If you attach .then and .catch as separate chains on the same promise, the rejection may still be considered unhandled by the engine. The correct way is to chain .then and .catch together. \n\nAdditionally, with async/await syntax, if you await a promise that rejects and do not wrap it in a try/catch block, it will also result in an unhandled promise rejection. To avoid this, always handle promise rejections either with .catch or try/catch (for async/await)."", ""code_snippet"": ""var somevar = false;\nvar PTest = function () {\n    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n        if (somevar === true)\n            resolve();\n        else\n            reject();\n    });\n}\nvar myfunc = PTest();\nmyfunc.then(function () {\n     console.log(\""Promise Resolved\"");\n}).catch(function () {\n     console.log(\""Promise Rejected\"");\n});\n\n// Example that can still cause unhandled rejection if not chained properly:\nvar somevar = false;\nvar PTest = function () {\n    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n        if (somevar === true)\n            resolve();\n        else\n            reject();\n    });\n}\nvar myfunc = PTest();\nmyfunc.then(function () {\n     console.log(\""Promise Resolved\"");\n});\n// See the Difference here\nmyfunc.catch(function () {\n     console.log(\""Promise Rejected\"");\n});\n\n// Async/await example:\nasync function getReadyForBed() {\n  let teethPromise = brushTeeth();\n  let tempPromise = getRoomTemperature();\n\n  // Change clothes based on room temperature\n  let temp = await tempPromise;\n  // Assume `changeClothes` also returns a Promise\n  if(temp > 20) {\n    await changeClothes(\""warm\"");\n  } else {\n    await changeClothes(\""cold\"");\n  }\n\n  await teethPromise;\n}\n\n// To avoid unhandled rejections with async/await, use try/catch:\nasync function example() {\n  try {\n    await somePromise();\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  }\n}""}",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_390748941858548682,Success,The bot successfully completed the task,,

So, the difference between stop and start is the number of elements selected (if step is 1, the default).\n\nThe other feature is that start or stop may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n\n    a[-1]    # last item in the array\n    a[-2:]   # last two items in the array\n    a[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n\nSimilarly, step may be a negative number:\n\n    a[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\n    a[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\n    a[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\n    a[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n\nPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for a[:-2] and a only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error.

To skip specifying a given argument, one might use None, so that e.g. a[start:] is equivalent to a[slice(start, None)] or a[::-1] is equivalent to a[slice(None, None, -1)].\n\nWhile the :-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of slice() objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing."", ""comments"": [{""author"": ""Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin"", ""content"": ""Slicing builtin types returns a copy but that's not universal.

Here's the draft:\n\n---\n\n**Digital Nomad Life**\n\nThe digital nomad lifestyle has become increasingly popular, offering the allure of freedom and flexibility that traditional work structures often lack. Imagine being able to work from a beach in Bali, a caf\u00e9 in Paris, or the comfort of your own home, all while maintaining a steady income. This lifestyle is not just a dream for Instagram influencers or startup entrepreneurs; it's a reality for many who have embraced the digital nomad way of life.\n\nThe key to achieving this freedom lies in how you structure your online business. By building a business that allows for location independence and flexible schedules, you can break free from the constraints of the traditional 9-to-5 grind. This article explores the essentials of the digital nomad lifestyle and how you can design a life that offers more time, money, and peace of mind.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs digital nomads, we often seek freedom from the constraints of traditional work and society. Yet, in our pursuit of this freedom, we must navigate the challenges of establishing ourselves in the digital world. As Jillian Amatt aptly puts it, \""Aren\u2019t most of us simply seeking freedom from the crush of society?\"" This quote encapsulates the essence of the digital nomad lifestyle, reminding us of the balance between freedom and responsibility.\n\n---\n\nWould you like any adjustments or additional content?""",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_390745578599018426,Success,The bot successfully completed the task,,

2354,tsk_390685819167661352,completed,"{""comprehensive_answer"": ""Climate change is significantly affecting global agriculture in multiple, interconnected ways, as detailed on Answers.com:\n\n1. Temperature Changes: Rising global temperatures are leading to decreased crop yields for many staple crops such as wheat, rice, and maize, which have optimal growth temperatures. Exceeding these temperatures reduces productivity. In some regions, warmer temperatures may extend growing seasons, but in others, heat stress can shorten them, negatively impacting harvests.\n\n2. Altered Precipitation Patterns: Climate change is causing increased evaporation and shifting precipitation patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This reduces crop production. Conversely, heavy rainfall and flooding can damage crops and erode soils, making land less productive.\n\n3. Soil Health: Extreme weather events linked to climate change exacerbate soil erosion, reducing land fertility. Changes in temperature and moisture also impact soil organisms, leading to nutrient depletion and overall soil degradation.\n\n4. Pests and Diseases: Warmer temperatures promote the proliferation of pests and pathogens, increasing the need for pesticides. Many pests and diseases are expanding their range into new areas, putting additional stress on crops that are not adapted to these threats.\n\n5. Extreme Weather Events: The frequency and intensity of storms and hurricanes are increasing, causing catastrophic damage to crops and agricultural infrastructure. Unpredictable weather patterns complicate planting and harvesting schedules, leading to economic uncertainty for farmers.\n\n6. Impact on Livestock: Livestock are vulnerable to heat stress, which affects their health, reproduction, and productivity. Changes in crop yields also impact the availability and cost of feed, affecting meat and dairy production.\n\n7. Economic Impacts: Fluctuations in crop yields due to climate change lead to increased food prices and market instability. Farmers may need to invest in new technologies or practices to adapt, which can be costly.\n\n8. Geographical Shifts: As temperatures rise, some areas become unsuitable for traditional crops, while new regions may become viable for agriculture. This can displace existing agricultural communities and require adaptation to new conditions.\n\nOverall, climate change poses significant challenges to global agriculture, threatening food security, livelihoods, and economies worldwide. Addressing these challenges requires adaptive strategies, such as sustainable farming practices, investment in research, and policy changes to support farmers in mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n\nResearch perspectives and related statistics referenced on Answers.com highlight that climate change is a major threat to global food security (as discussed in academic papers and reports by organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The site also notes that increased greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, are key drivers of these changes. The economic consequences include market volatility and increased adaptation costs for farmers. The need for adaptation strategies and sustainable practices is emphasized as essential for maintaining agricultural productivity and food security in a changing climate."", ""source_url"": ""https://www.answers.com/search?q=How+is+climate+change+affecting+global+agriculture%3F"", ""extracted_at"": ""2025-05-07T17:03:25.969509-04:00""}",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_390685819167661352/actions,Success,The bot successfully completed the task,,
2355,tsk_390741515559955714,completed,"{""answer_full"": ""Renewable energy refers to energy derived from natural processes that are continuously replenished. Here\u2019s a detailed overview of how various types of renewable energy work:\n\n1. Solar Energy\n- How It Works: Solar energy harnesses sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) cells or solar thermal collectors.\n  - Photovoltaic Cells: Convert sunlight directly into electricity. When sunlight strikes the cells, it knocks electrons loose from atoms, generating a flow of electricity.\n  - Solar Thermal Collectors: Capture sunlight to heat a fluid, which can then be used to generate steam that drives a turbine to produce electricity.\n\n2. Wind Energy\n- How It Works: Wind energy is generated by converting the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical power.\n  - Wind Turbines: Large blades capture wind energy, causing them to rotate. This rotation turns a generator that produces electricity.\n  - Onshore & Offshore: Wind farms can be located on land (onshore) or in bodies of water (offshore), where wind speeds are often higher.\n\n3. Hydropower\n- How It Works: Hydropower uses the energy of flowing water to generate electricity.\n  - Dams: Water stored in a reservoir behind a dam is released to flow through turbines, generating electricity.\n  - Run-of-the-River Systems: These systems divert a portion of river water through a turbine without large-scale storage.\n\n4. Biomass Energy\n- How It Works: Biomass energy comes from organic materials, such as plants and animal waste.\n  - Combustion: Biomass can be burned to produce heat or electricity.\n  - Biogas: Organic matter decomposes in anaerobic conditions, producing methane that can be captured and used as a fuel.\n  - Biofuels: Biomass is processed into liquid fuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, for transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal Energy\n- How It Works: Geothermal energy harnesses heat from the Earth\u2019s interior.\n  - Geothermal Power Plants: Use steam extracted from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate electricity.\n  - Direct Use Applications: Hot water from geothermal sources can be used directly for heating buildings or in agricultural processes.\n\n6. Ocean Energy\n- How It Works: Ocean energy can be harnessed from tides, waves, and temperature differences in ocean water.\n  - Tidal Energy: Utilizes the rise and fall of tides to generate electricity through turbines.\n  - Wave Energy: Captures energy from surface waves or the movement of water columns.\n  - Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC): Uses temperature differences between warmer surface water and colder deep water to generate electricity.\n\nConclusion\nRenewable energy sources are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. They are sustainable, abundant, and increasingly cost-effective compared to fossil fuels. As technology advances and investments in renewable infrastructure grow, the global energy landscape is shifting towards a more sustainable future.""}",https://app.skyvern.com/tasks/tsk_390741515559955714,Failure,"Insted of composing a answer for given question, The bot has searched for it and extracted the output",FALSE,"The issue described is related to the AI agent's behavior of searching for information instead of composing an answer.

Economic Growth:\n   - Investment Inflows: Globalization often leads to increased foreign direct investment (FDI), which can stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and enhance productivity.\n   - Innovation and Technology Transfer: Exposure to global markets encourages firms to innovate and adopt new technologies, enhancing competitiveness.\n3. Job Creation:\n   - Employment Opportunities: New markets and increased foreign investment can create new jobs in various sectors, including manufacturing, services, and technology.\n4. Access to Goods and Services:\n   - Diverse Products: Consumers benefit from a wider variety of goods and services, often at lower prices due to increased competition.\n5. Increased Efficiency:\n   - Economies of Scale: Companies can achieve lower costs through higher production volumes, leading to more competitive pricing.\n\nNegative Impacts:\n1. Income Inequality:\n   - Widening Gap: Globalization can exacerbate income inequality both within and between countries, as benefits may accrue disproportionately to skilled workers and capital owners.\n2. Job Displacement:\n   - Manufacturing Decline: In developed countries, globalization can lead to job losses in traditional industries as firms relocate production to countries with lower labor costs.\n3. Cultural Homogenization:\n   - Loss of Local Cultures: The spread of global brands and cultural products can overshadow local businesses and cultural practices, leading to a loss of cultural identity.\n4. Environmental Concerns:\n   - Resource Exploitation: Increased production and consumption can lead to environmental degradation, as countries may exploit natural resources without adequate regulations.\n5. Vulnerability to Global Shocks:\n   - Economic Instability: Greater interconnectedness means that economic shocks in one part of the world can rapidly affect others, as seen during financial crises.\n\nConclusion:\nThe economic impacts of globalization are multifaceted and can vary widely depending on factors such as a country's level of development, regulatory frameworks, and social safety nets. While globalization can drive economic growth and improve living standards, it also poses challenges that must be managed to ensure equitable benefits across different segments of society.
