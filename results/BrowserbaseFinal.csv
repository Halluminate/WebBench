From adorable animals to jaw-dropping stunts, these short clips capture our attention and spread like wildfire across social media platforms. But beyond the laughs and gasps, viral videos often carry unexpected lessons that reflect deeper truths about human nature, creativity, and the power of connection.\n\nOne of the most surprising lessons from viral videos is the importance of authenticity. Audiences are drawn to genuine moments\u2014whether it\u2019s a child\u2019s unfiltered reaction, a pet\u2019s quirky behavior, or a spontaneous act of kindness. These unscripted snippets remind us that real emotions and experiences resonate far more than polished productions. In a world saturated with curated content, authenticity stands out and forges a stronger bond between creators and viewers.\n\nAnother key takeaway is the value of creativity and resourcefulness. Many viral sensations are born from simple ideas executed with a unique twist. Think of the countless dance challenges, clever life hacks, or homemade music covers that have taken the internet by storm. These videos prove that you don\u2019t need a big budget or fancy equipment to make an impact\u2014just imagination and the courage to share your vision.\n\nViral videos also highlight the power of community and collective action. Whether it\u2019s rallying support for a charitable cause or spreading awareness about important issues, these clips can mobilize millions in a matter of hours. The speed and scale at which information travels online demonstrate how interconnected we\u2019ve become, and how a single moment can inspire global conversations and real-world change.\n\nFinally, viral videos teach us to embrace the unexpected. The most memorable clips often defy our expectations, blending humor, surprise, and relatability in ways that leave a lasting impression. They encourage us to find joy in the ordinary, celebrate our differences, and approach life with a sense of curiosity and wonder.\n\nIn the end, the world\u2019s most viral videos are more than just fleeting entertainment\u2014they\u2019re snapshots of our collective experience, offering insights and inspiration in the most unexpected ways.""}",https://app.skyvern.com/workflows/wpid_392583744000437746/wr_392583744000437748/overview,Success,The bot successfully completed the task,,

There are few books where the beginning paragraphs hit a home run for me, and this is one of them. It has been a long month filled with family time and endless cooking so for the last ten days I opted for comfort reads and there is no family who provides comfort like the Finches, with the exception of Aunt Alexandra. \u201cLawyers were children once,\u201d quotes Charles Lamb in the opening epithet. Prior to this reading, I viewed Atticus Finch as an unapproachable, older father. Beloved by his children to the point of idolization, but with an impenetrable outer skin. As an adult looking back at the events which shaped the novel, Scout paints the picture of her father as one who makes everything right and makes her feel safe. Even though this novel had been marketed for adults, it is in its essence a coming of age novel, which shows Scout\u2019s growth through elementary school while her family faces events that mean to alter the history of a town. Atticus would need to be a strong figure to guide his children through the plot, and he would need to wistfully remember his childhood in order to relate to them. This is the man who told us all to walk in another\u2019s shoes and see things from their point of view. Until today, I never viewed Atticus as multi-faceted, just a great man. Today that view slightly changed, yet he remains one of my top personas of all time.\n\nPestering Boo Radley is like killing a mockingbird, Scout implores Atticus. He never did anyone harm. There is a reason why this novel won the Pulitzer as being ahead of its time. The beginning and ending paragraphs mirror each other and provide closure. Scout and Dill engage in childhood escapades while learning life lessons imparted on them by their neighbors. Jem believes that the story began the summer Dill came and he tried to make Boo Radley come out. Being four years Scout\u2019s senior at the time, he already saw the events of the novel from an adult perspective. Scout and Dill did not. They started as innocent seven year olds who thought that they would get married one day and ended as empathetic individuals who wanted to change the world. Perhaps Atticus\u2019 lessons had penetrated these children after all; Scout, at least, looked like a lawyer in the making. If the world changed in her lifetime, perhaps she would get that opportunity.\n\nWith a book as perfect as this one, it comes as little wonder to me that Harper Lee never published another in her lifetime. She became a recluse; perhaps she modeled Boo Radley after her own tendencies. Boo did not come out because he did not want to. I am of the camp who is 99.9% sure to never read Go Set a Watchman. To Kill a Mockingbird is practically perfect in every way and made to change the way a nation thought about groups of people. Harper Lee had as much courage in publishing it pre- Civil Rights Act as the characters in her novel did in living with there preconceived notions of how the world functions. Bravery, courage, and empathy remain the overarching motifs in this great American novel. I view it as the ultimate comfort read and in the words of my reading friend Tessa, five stars and a heart."", ""likes"": 646, ""comments"": 98, ""shelves"": [""500-great-books-women"", ""all-time-favorites"", ""classics""]}, {""user"": {""name"": ""leynes"", ""profile_url"": ""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45198798-leynes"", ""avatar_url"": ""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1738536444i/45198798._UY200_CR27,0,200,200_.jpg""}, ""review_url"": ""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2018298597"", ""date"": ""2022-03-24"", ""rating"": 2, ""review_text"": ""/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///\n\nThis is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.\n\nAnd that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve.\n\nHarper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there \u2013 waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.\n\nBlack people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of \""not all white people\"":\nJames Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.\nThis right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it\u2019s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them.\n\nAs a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the \""happy black\"", the contented slave \u2013 the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk \u2013 passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch \u2013 the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson\u2019s death on his family up close \u2013 we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.\n\nI was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin \u2013 a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?\n\nSince finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a \""good n*gger\"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:\n\nMost Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases \u2013 property, tort, contract, dept, insurance \u2013 and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation.\n\nOnly the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman \u2013 no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get.\n\nOftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]\n\nThis book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all...\nHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.\n\n- Martin Luther King, Jr."", ""likes"": 2144, ""comments"": 274, ""shelves"": []}, {""user"": {""name"": ""Stephen"", ""profile_url"": ""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen"", ""avatar_url"": ""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1311616811i/1413439._UY200_CR33,0,200,200_.jpg""}, ""review_url"": ""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/94754648"", ""date"": ""2011-05-24"", ""rating"": 5, ""review_text"": ""6.0 stars. I know I am risking a serious \u201cFILM AT 11\u201d moment and a club upside the head from Captain Obvious for voicing this, but nabbit dog I still think it needs to be said\u2026TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the BEST and MOST IMPORTANT American novels ever written. Okay, I said it, and I will wait patiently while you get your DUHs and DERs out of the way and hang your \u201cno shit\u201d signs outside for Inspector Holmes.\n\nOkay, now given the gruntload of reviews/ratings this book has I know I\u2019m not the first person to wag my chin about how amazing it is. Still, I am going to chance coming off like that annoying dingleberry at the tail end of a huge porcelain party because I truly have a pile of love for this book. \u2026(Sorry for taking the metanalogy there just now, but I promise no more poop references for the rest of the review)... So if my review can bring a few more people into the Atticus Finch Fan Club, I will be just flush with happy.\n\nOn one level, this book is a fairly straight-forward coming of age story about life in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. It has a very slice of lifesaver warmth and simplicity to it that I think resonates with a lot of readers. It certainly does with me and I think the adjective \u201ccharm\u201d may have been invented to describe the novel.\n\nDespite how easing flowing the narrative is, this book is both extremely and deceptively powerful in its discussion of race, tolerance and human decency. Most importantly, this book shows us by example the courage to stand all up in the grill of injustice and say \u201cNot today, Asshole! Not on my watch.\u201d\n\nThat is a lesson that I think we can never be reminded of too often. When bad people do bad things to good people, the rest of us good people need to sack up and be counted regardless of how scary it might be. Easier said then done, I know. But at least that should be the standard to which we strive.\n\nAtticus Fitch is the epitome of that standard. He is the role model to end all role models and what is most impressive is that he comes across as such a REAL person. There is no John Wayne/Jack Bauer/Dirty Harry cavalry charging BSD machismo about him. Just a direct, unflinching, unrelenting willingness to always do what he thinks is right. As Atticus\u2019 daughter Scout puts it so well:\nIt was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.\nI was to make something crystal before going on because it is an important part of my love of this story. Notwithstanding this book's powerful, powerful moral message, it never once\u2026ever\u2026comes off as preachy or heavy handed. There is no lecture to be given here. The only sermon we are privy to is the example of Atticus Finch and the simple yet unwavering strength and quiet decency of the man. Even when asked by his daughter about the horrendous racism being displayed by the majority of the townsfolk during a critical point in the story, Atticus responds with conviction but without:\n\""They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.\""\nThis is a special story. Oh, and as a huge bonus\u2026it is also an absolute joy to read. Lee\u2019s prose is silky smooth and as cool as the other side of the pillow. Read this book. Read it with your children, read it with your spouse, read it by yourself\u2026.read it the bigoted assclown that you work with or see around the neighborhood\u2026Just make sure you read it. It is a timeless classic and one of the books that I consider a \u201clife changer.\u201d 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!!\n\nBONUS QUOTE: This is Scout talking to Atticus after getting to know someone she had previously be afraid of:\n\n\u201c \u2018When they finally saw him, why he hadn\u2019t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .\u2019 His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. \u2018Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\u2019 He turned out the light and went into Jem\u2019s room.

Glucose is your body's main source of energy and comes from the food you eat as well as being produced by your body.

In diabetes, your body either can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. As a result, too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells, causing high blood glucose levels. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious health conditions. There are different types of diabetes, including type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes, each with different causes and risk factors. Symptoms can include increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, blurry vision, numbness or tingling in the extremities, sores that do not heal, and unexplained weight loss.

1886,tsk_v2_392917884371676472,completed,"{""executive_summary"": ""Introduction\n\nA quiet year, but with inflection points\nFor a year with no crises impacting travel worldwide \u2014 the pandemic has abated, inflation appears tamed, the dreaded recession never took hold and \u201cnormalization\u201d became a buzzword \u2014 I think 2024 will be recalled for several industry-changing inflection points.\n\nAI\nLess than two years after ChatGPT\u2019s debut, a third of travel advisors say they have used AI to assist marketing or website content creation. Given AI\u2019s capabilities, this may not seem like a lot, but it\u2019s a relatively healthy adoption rate; as a reference point, in 2004, only 10% of Vacation.com\u2019s members had a booking engine on their sites, 11 years after the web had become publicly available.\n\nWhat is most directly indicative of AI\u2019s future utility as an advisor tool is that this year\u2019s Travel Industry Survey indicates that 58% of advisors age 45 or younger have already used it in their businesses. It\u2019s likely that if millennial and Gen Z travel professionals are using it, consumers in that age cohort (and a coming generation of AI natives) will embrace it. Generating custom itineraries is the second most-used function among advisors; one can assume that DIY consumers are also testing it for that purpose.\n\nIt\u2019s good to remember that early nervousness about the web\u2019s existential threat to advisors not only proved unfounded, but OTAs arguably ushered in the era of strong professional expertise among advisors, in part to differentiate themselves from online retailers. I suspect that the answers to requests by consumers for AI itinerary planning may include an AI recommendation to use a travel advisor to review and book complex trips. If so, advisors will want to burnish online credentials in anticipation of the next question: \u201cChatGPT, how can I find a travel advisor with the expertise to assist me with this trip?\u201d\n\nLUXURY\nAlmost three-quarters of advisors in the survey claim \u201chigh-end luxury\u201d as an area of specialization, an increase of 8 percentage points over last year.\n\nWhile the expansion of luxury products has been a commission boon to advisors, I do have concerns in areas of travel where purchased privileges and mass-market travel visibly overlap, particularly in theme parks.\n\nAcross-the-board rising travel costs have already strained the ability of the middle class to enjoy an Orlando vacation. And it\u2019s further disheartening to stand in line with impatient children under the Florida sun while those who can afford to are enabled by management to cut the line.\n\nI remember a Disney executive once proudly telling me that its free FastPass, introduced 25 years ago, reflected the company\u2019s egalitarian approach versus Universal\u2019s pay-for-play Express Pass. Disney now has another level of for-pay line-cutting passes. It\u2019s not good for the industry (nor humanity, in my opinion) to so clearly facilitate distinction between the have-nots, haves and have-mores.\n\nNDC\nNDC access has almost doubled since the previous year\u2019s survey, and while 54% of advisors still have a negative view of it, there has been less uncertainty about its potential to do harm, thanks to American Airline\u2019s disastrous, anti-advisor rollout earlier this year. Not only did the airline ultimately have to broadcast mea culpas far and wide, but the rest of commercial aviation took note of how not to deploy NDC.\n\nIn my mind, there\u2019s little question that, even in its most advisor-friendly forms, NDC tilts distribution in favor of direct bookings. Unless, that is, advisors take note of how they, too, can effectively increase sales through targeted, customized marketing. While an airline\u2019s data sets and computing power are on its side, the essentials of what NDC does \u2014 tailor offers based on observed traveler preferences \u2014 can be used with a much more personal touch by advisors.\n\nArnie Weissmann\nExecutive Vice President and Editor in Chief, Travel Weekly""}",#REF!,Success,The bot successfully completed the task,,

She doesn't do sun. But after her divorced parents can't agree on who gets to have her for the summer, Waverly gets shipped off to Holden, Florida, to spend a couple months with her aunt, Rachel. There's one minor hiccup: Blake Hamilton, Rachel's seventeen-year-old neighbor. He's athletic, outgoing, arrogant, tan, and pretty much Waverly's exact opposite. She's eager to avoid him at all costs, hoping to fit in with the other kids in Holden without drawing too much attention to herself. But when Blake discovers that Waverly has been hiding the rather embarrassing secret that she can't swim, he does the unthinkable: He offers to teach her.

The cut end near the bottom is brought up to the other cut end just below the duodenum, bypassing a large segment of the small intestine.
