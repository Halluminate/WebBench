In a small saucepan, bring the honey and thyme just to a boil, then remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.\n2. Gently toss the peaches with 2 teaspoons of the flour to coat thoroughly, then toss them with 2 tablespoons of the honey. Set the peaches aside.\n3. In a large bowl, whisk the cold flour, sugar, and salt together. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender or forks until the mixture looks like slightly chunky wet sand.\n4. Using a fork, stir in 5 tablespoons of water to bring the dough together. You might need to add in another 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, but be careful not to add too much; the dough will leave some unincorporated crumbs at the bottom of the bowl, and the dough itself should not feel at all wet. \n5. Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and briefly work the dough by hand to mix the crumbs into the dough. The dough should not look smooth and completely homogeneous; you want to see discernible bits of butter.\n6. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n7. Preheat the oven to 400\u00ba F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a circle roughly 14 to 16 inches across and transfer it to the center of a parchment- or Silpat-lined baking sheet.\n8. Pile the peaches in the center of dough so that there is about a 2-inch border of dough surrounding the fruit. You can stack the fruit quite high if you like.\n9. With lightly floured fingertips, create the galette by bringing up the edges of the dough up and over the edge of the fruit. Overlap the folds and gently pinch them together; continue working around the fruit until you've formed a lightly mounded volcano of dough with the fruit visible in the mouth of it.\n10. Lightly whisk the egg yolk with the milk or water, and brush it over the dough.\n11. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the dough is golden and the fruit begins to soften a bit. Remove from the oven and allow to cool until it's just warm.\n12. Mix 2 tablespoons of the thyme-infused honey with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.
